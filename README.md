## Overview of the project

- A web page, which contains 3 tabs (Upcoming Campaigns, Live Campaign, Past campaigns).
- Each tab should show relevant data based on the status of campaign.

- Added functionality to reschedule a campaign by opening a calendar on clicking the Schedule again icon. (Whatever date you select, should be shown in the first column named "Date". The time diff shown against it should also be updated).

- Once the date is changed of campaign. The campaign moves to the relevant Tab (Upcoming,Live,Past) , based on the date selected.

- Clicking on View Pricing in the row it shows a modal with relevant information of the campaign.
